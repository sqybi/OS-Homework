<h1>Driver-Conductor Model</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Aim</h2>

<p>Implement the driver-conductor model.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are one driver and two conductors on the bus which has two doors.</li>
<li>Each conductor has management of one of the doors.</li>
<li>The driver won't start the bus until all the doors are closed.</li>
<li>The conductors will open the door when bus stops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each driver or conductor corresponding to a sperated thread, then finish the synchronization of the three threads by semaphore.</p>

<h2>Compile</h2>

<p>Just execute <code>make</code> (make need to be installed) to make the program, and a file named "bus" will be generated.</p>

<p>The command <code>make clean</code> will clean all temporary files, including the executable program "bus".</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>You must compile before run the program.</p>

<p>Enter <code>./bus</code> to execute the program. <br />
Then everything is to be done automatically, and each thread will tell you what it is doing by print something in terminal.</p>

<p>If you want to terminate the program, press enter directly.</p>

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>

<p>By default, it takes each conductor 3 seconds to close the door, and 5 to 7 seconds (randomly) for each stop, and 5 to 7 seconds for the bus to run from one station to another station. <br />
You could modify this by edit the source code.</p>

<h2>Others</h2>

<p>The two conductors' name are Madoka and Homora, which comes from the animation <em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</em>.</p>
