= Aim =
 Implement the driver-conductor model.
 . There are one driver and two conductors on the bus which has two doors.
 . Each conductor has management of one of the doors.
 . The driver won't start the bus until all the doors are closed.
 . The conductors will open the door when bus stops.
 Each driver or conductor corresponding to a sperated thread, then finish the
synchronization of the three threads by semaphore.

= Compile =
 Just execute "make" (make need to be installed) to make the program, and a file
named "bus" will be generated.
 The command "make clean" will clean all temporary files, including the
executable programs "client" and "server".

= Usage =
 You must compile before run the program.

 Enter "./bus" to execute the program. Then everything is to be done
automatically, and each thread will tell you what it is doing by print something
in terminal.
 If you want to terminate the program, press enter directly.

= Advanced Usage =
 By default, it takes each conductor 3 seconds to close the door, and 5 to 7
seconds (randomly) for each stop, and 5 to 7 seconds for the bus to run from
one station to another station. You could modify this by edit the original
code.

= Others =
 The two conductors' name are Madoka and Homora, which comes from the animation
"Puella Magi Madoka Magica".
